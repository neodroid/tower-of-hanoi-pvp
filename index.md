## Game Description

The Tower Puzzle Game is a two-player strategy game where each player aims to move all their blocks from their starting tower to their target tower, using intermediate towers labeled 'A', 'B', 'C', etc.

## How to Play

- **Objective:** Be the first to move all your blocks to your target tower.
- **Setup:**
  - Choose the number of middle towers (minimum of 3).
  - Choose the number of blocks for each player (minimum of 3).
  - Start the game to generate the towers and blocks.
- **Gameplay:**
  - Players take turns moving one block at a time.
  - Blocks can be moved to any tower but cannot be placed on top of a smaller block.
  - Use the drag-and-drop interface to move blocks.
  - **No Repeating Positions:** Players cannot make a move that results in a game state that has occurred previously. If a move would repeat a previous position, it is not allowed, and the player must choose a different move.
- **Winning the Game:** The first player to successfully move all their blocks to their target tower wins.
