            <h2>Game Description</h2>
            <p>The Tower Puzzle Game is a two-player strategy game where each player aims to move all their blocks from their starting tower to their target tower, using intermediate towers labeled 'A', 'B', 'C', etc.</p>
            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Be the first to move all your blocks to your target tower.</li>
                <li><strong>Setup:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choose the number of middle towers (minimum of 3).</li>
                        <li>Choose the number of blocks for each player (minimum of 3).</li>
                        <li>Start the game to generate the towers and blocks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Players take turns moving one block at a time.</li>
                        <li>Blocks can be moved to any tower but cannot be placed on top of a smaller block.</li>
                        <li>Use the drag-and-drop interface to move blocks.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Repeating Positions:</strong> Players cannot make a move that results in a game state that has occurred previously. If a move would repeat a previous position, it is not allowed, and the player must choose a different move.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> The first player to successfully move all their blocks to their target tower wins.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Enjoy the game!</p>
